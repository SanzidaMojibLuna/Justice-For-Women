The app creates a common platform for both victims and indivisuals and organizations from where they can seek help. General users and legal practioners can have authentic accounts through which they can contact the other party.

NGO and voluntary organizations can be registered on the app and users can seek help from them as well if needed.

There is also an option for contacting law enforcement. Users can send a massage to emergency contact with current location information if they are in dire situation.
